1. How to identify a variable is value type variable or nullable type variable?
Ans : - If the variable is declared using primitive datatype and has not been used any square bracket sign then we can say this is value type variable.
        Nullable type variable or reference variable: - If the Variable is declared in non primitive style then this will be called Nullable type variable.
